## Deployment on Heroku

The app was written with a Heroku deployment stack in mind. You can easily deploy the application using the button below, or you can deploy it anywhere assuming you can run Ruby 2.5.1 and Rails 5.2.2 with a PostgreSQL database.

The Heroku stack will use the Heroku PostgreSQL addons.
